	<h3>How much does Serverless Dashboard cost?</h3>
</hgroup>

<p>
	Serverless Dashboard is free to use and explore with our DEVELOPER TIER. We reserve the right to
	throttle or suspend accounts that abuse the platform. Startup and Growth plans include an
	allotment of usage every month with pay-per-use pricing on usage that exceeds the included
	resources. Enterprise accounts are available for organizations running large applications that
	require significant resources. Please see the pricing matrix below for more plan comparison.
